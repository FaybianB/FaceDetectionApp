# FaceDetectionApp
Welcome to FaceDetectionApp, an advanced face detection application powered by artificial intelligence. Leveraging the capabilities of the OpenCV library, FaceDetectionApp provides users with the ability to detect faces in images, videos, and real-time through a webcam. This intuitive application is designed for users seeking a reliable and efficient tool for face detection tasks.

## Features
- **Image Face Detection**: Detect faces within any static image file.
- **Video Face Detection**: Analyze video files to detect faces frame by frame.
- **Live Webcam Detection**: Real-time face detection using your computer's webcam.

## Getting Started
To get started with FaceDetectionApp, ensure you have Python and OpenCV installed on your system. This application relies on the OpenCV library (cv2) and `utilizes haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` for accurate face detection.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- OpenCV library

To install OpenCV, run the following command:

```
pip install opencv-python
```

## Installation
Clone the repository or download the source code:

```
git clone https://github.com/FaybianB/FaceDetectionApp.git
```

Navigate to the downloaded directory:

```
cd FaceDetectionApp
```

The application is now ready to use.

## Usage
FaceDetectionApp can be used in three modes: image face detection, video face detection, and live webcam detection.

### Detecting Faces in an Image
To detect faces in an image file, run the following command:

```
python3 image_face_detector.py <path to image file>
```

*NOTE: Replace `<path to image file>` with the actual path to your image.*

### Detecting Faces in a Video
To detect faces in a video file, execute the following command:

```
python3 video_face_detector.py <path to video file>
```

Ensure to replace `<path to video file>` with the path to your video file.

### Detecting Faces through Live Webcam
For real-time face detection using your webcam, use:

```
python3 webcam_face_detector.py
```

This will activate your webcam and start detecting faces in real-time.

## Libraries and Resources
This application uses the following key library and resource:

- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For processing and analyzing images and videos.
- **Haar Cascade Classifier**: Utilizes `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` for detecting faces in various inputs.
